        <p>
            My name is <strong>Marco Kleimans</strong> and as of today, I am <strong class="age"></strong>. I am currently living in
            Houston, Texas, with my amazing girlfriend who is finishing her Master's degree at Rice University. I was born
            in Moscow, Russia, but spent most of my childhood in Buenos Aires, Argentina, where I grew up.
            I then moved to Los Angeles, California, where I graduated from the
            <a href="https://www.usc.edu/" target="_blank">University of Southern California</a> with a
            Bachelor's and a Master's degree in
            <a href="https://cee.usc.edu/academics/undergraduate-programs/environmental-engineering/" target="_blank">Environmental Engineering</a>.
            After graduation – and as a result of life decisions and opportunities – I decided to pivot away from Environmental
            Engineering and started working as a Web Developer at the <a href="https://www.isi.edu/" target="_blank">Information Sciences Institute</a>.
        </p>
        <p>As <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jostein_Gaarder" target="_blank">Jostein Gaarder</a> -
            my favorite writer and philosopher from Norway - claims, embracing uncertainty and accepting one's shortcomings
            is a critical first step towards self-improvement and realization. His book "<em>The Solitaire Mystery</em>" has been
            a hallmark for me, as it narrates the story of a father and son who relentlessly search for their missing
            wife and mother, while strange encounters with mythical creatures along the way inspire a though-provoking
            exploration of the meaning of life. This is a metaphor of the search for purpose, perseverance, and determination.
            It is about understanding that life is not just a destination, but rather a non-linear journey
            in which we, the travellers, have to deal, accept, and learn from the unexpected. </p>
        <p>This story is my banner: I always enthusiastic about facing new challenges that force me to step outside my
            comfort zone, but I am also pragmatic and always looking forward to learning and developing new skills.
            I consider myself methodical and organized, persevering and energetic, and both flexible and always well-disposed.
            I'm passionate about new technologies, and optimistic about the future. Having a multicultural background
            allows me to analyze complex situations from different perspectives to find the most fitting solution for each scenario.
            I enjoy learning, sharing, and helping others accomplish their goals, approaching all tasks with open-mindedness
            and excitement.</p>

                                Institute</a> is a world-class leader in cutting-edge computing technologies: AI, Quantum Computing,
                                Space Research, Microchips, Networking and Cybersecurity, Social Media and Health,
                                and many others.
                                <p>I started my job at ISI as a student worker in July 2021. As a result of my commitment, malleability, and adroitness,
                                I was later offered a full-time position as a Web Developer I. Working as a web developer
                                at ISI meant that I had to adapt to a very fast-paced, constantly evolving environment and
                                had to learn new technologies and concepts from scratch. Environmental Engineering is
                                not computer-heavy, and programming is not part of the core curriculum. However, I accepted this
                                challenge and, step-by-step, learned the tools needed to become a proficient entry level developer capable of
                                completing and excelling at my tasks in the institute.</p>
                            <p>Not only did I learn programming languages like HTML, CSS, PHP, and Javascript, but I
                                also learnt how to use tools like WordPress, BeaverBuilder, WP Engine,
                                Jira, Trello, GitHub, the terminal, SharePoint, and the
                                Affinity Suite, among others. I also had to collaborate with staff from different departments,
                                organize and share work-progress during meetings, and provide training for some of our
                                platforms. Last but not least, I was involved in promoting and catering DEI efforts, as
                                well as accessibility compliance for ISI's website.</p>
                                <p>Among the most relevant <a href="#projects">projects</a> I completed, I helped migrate more than
                                300 websites from Drupal - the old Content Management System (CMS) used at ISI - to WordPress, which involved moving
                                more than 1000 webpages from an on-premise server to the website hosting service WP Engine. This
                                included redesigning the websites and adapting the content and media to the new layout using
                                WordPress, custom-built themes, and Beaver Builder. I was also largely in charge of
                                maintaining ISI's documentation website (Action), which involved creating documentation,
                                designing the layout, and providing the most reasonable information. For more detailed

                            to explore practical implementations of environmental engineering. After researching available

                            <p>Throughout my years of experience in the lab, I was in charge of making solutions and dilutions
                            of water samples to test for the formation of byproducts using a mass spectrometer. Some of the
                            techniques used involved liquid-liquid extraction, UV radiation, and pH buffering, among others.</p>
                            <p>Self-discipline and consistency are a must. Some days, I would spend more than 5 hours at

                            <p>Both as a Customer Service Representative and Supervisor I was required to be a team-player.
                            This job helped me develop my interpersonal skills and treat customers with the appropriate tone,
                            attitude, and language. Furthermore, it required exceptional time-management and organization,
                            in order to keep track of requests, packages, mail, and calls, while balancing college social life,
                            work, academics, research and physical activity. By the time I became supervisor, I was working
                            20 hours per week on top of all the aforementioned responsibilities.</p>

                <p>Working at ISI has been exciting, stimulating, demanding, and enlightening. Pursuing a degree in
                    (Environmental) engineering has allowed me to become highly adaptable and capable to digest complex

                        <h4>Maintaining the ISI Website Environment</h4>
                        <p>When I first joined ISI in 2021, the process of migrating the main institute website was already
                        put in motion. I was initially hired a <strong>Student Worker</strong> to aid my boss with the process of adapting
                        all the web-related content to the new Content Management System (CMS) - WordPress. My boss has been working
                        for the company for more than 20 years as a Web Developer, and this was the first time he was onboarding
                        a helping hand. The Web Development Team saw a staggering growth of 100% - now it contained two members
                        when they hired me for the position of <strong>Web Developer I</strong> in February 2022.</p>
                        <p><a href="https://wordpress.org/" target="_blank">WordPress</a>, when combined with <a
                        href="https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com/" target="_blank">Beaver Builder</a>, allows for a seamless,
                        easy-to-deploy site creation and management experience. While WordPress facilitates the management
                        of the sites, Beaver Builder allows users to create webpages using modules with a drag-and-drop
                        interface. From an end-user perspective, maintaining websites is straightforward and
                        intuitive. However, developing the backend of this software is much more complicated and requires
                        broad programming skills and understanding.</p>
                        <p>At first, I was in charge of dealing with basic tasks - mostly <strong>frontend</strong>: adding page elements to webpages, learning
                        how to navigate WordPress and Beaver Builder, taking notes on the progress I was making with the
                        website and the migrations, and occasionally designing very simple elements. However, as the time passed
                        and I became more adept and knowledgeable of the programming requirements and the platforms, I was encouraged
                        to partake in more advanced tasks, dealing with <strong>backend</strong>. This involved the design and deployment of webpages, complex web
                        elements, and some functional sections of the webpage.</p>
                        <p>Ultimately, the <strong>modernization of the ISI Web environment</strong> was a multistep process, which involved
                        several <strong>cycles of migrations</strong> from Drupal - the old CMS - to WordPress. First, the main ISI website.
                        Next, large department websites, followed by smaller group websites involving research groups, centers,
                        and projects within ISI. Lastly, personal and legacy websites. This added up to <strong>over
                        3000 webpages</strong> that were reviewed to decide whether they were worth migrating, archiving, or deleting. Along these
                        migrations, new websites were developed, and existing websites were updated.</p>

                        <h4>Deploying and Maintaining the ISI Sub-sites</h4>
                        <p>Nowadays, the ISI WordPress ecosystem consists of more than <strong>50 sites and 1000
                            webpages</strong>. One crucial aspect of using WordPress are templates. These allow for a reliable website deployment
                            that ensures the design remains constant across all different sites within the domain. These
                            templates can be custom-built from scratch to fit the needs of a company, or downloaded and
                            installed into the WordPress instance. However, building templates from the ground involves
                            mastery in web development, as it requires expert-level knowledge of programming.</p>
                        <p>At first, the ISI WordPress system contained only 2 templates, and today it has 6. We build
                            ISI's main site and all sub-sites on top of these templates. Below are some of the most
                            notable and impactful website I worked on and deployed using WordPress and Beaver Builder:</p>

                            Southern California Information Sciences Institute, is part of a Department of Defense

                            Sciences Act of 2022. </p>
                        <p>This was a major project due to the scope and relevance of the DREAMS contracts. I worked
                        on the following pages: the <em>Homepage</em>, the <em>News</em>, the
                            <em>Leadership</em> amd <em>Partners</em>, the <em>Mosis 2.0</em> and <em>Prototyping Capabilities</em>
                            , and the <em>Workforce Development</em>.</p>

                        <p>ISI celebrated its anniversary in 2022, when the institute officially turned 50 years old.
                        As part of the celebration, and to promote the event, the Website Development Team was requested
                        to build a website for the event.</p>
                        <p>Since this website is not built on WordPress, we had to develop the design from the start. I
                        worked on deploying most of the webpages, including the following: the <em>Homepage</em>, the <em>History</em>, the
                        <em>Symposium</em>, the <em>Start-ups</em>, the <em>Pioneers</em>, the <em>Photos</em>, and
                        the <em>Speakers</em>. I also worked on other design elements, such as the menu, the masthead,
                        and the footer.</p>

                        <h4>Promoting DEI Efforts</h4>
                        <p>Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) are crucial for fostering a workplace and society where
                            all individuals feel valued, respected, and empowered to contribute their unique perspectives
                            and talents. This leads to enhanced creativity and innovation, as diverse
                            teams bring different viewpoints that drive problem-solving and decision-making. Prioritizing
                            DEI helps to address systemic inequalities, promoting social justice and creating
                            a more equitable environment for everyone.</p>
                        <p>ISI is notable for catering an extremely accepting and diverse community. With workers from
                        all the corners and backgrounds of the world, <strong>ISI is at the forefront of fostering a
                                multicultural environment</strong>.</p>
                        <p>As a web developer, we can help creating communication channels to convey DEI efforts and
                        promote projects that embrace these ideas. Fortunately, I was in charge of creating the
                        <strong>ISI DEI webpage</strong> and the <strong>Stimulating STEM Summer Program webpage</strong>,
                        which was designed to promote an interest in STEM
                        among students from marginalized communities in a free, 4-week residential experience.</p>

                            <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/" target="_blank">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)</a>,
                            accessibility compliance is
                            essential for ensuring that individuals with disabilities can effectively access and interact
                            with digital content, products, and services. By adhering to accessibility standards,
                            organizations not only fulfill legal obligations but also enhance user experience,
                            fostering inclusivity and broadening their audience reach. Furthermore, prioritizing accessibility
                            demonstrates a commitment to social responsibility and equity, ultimately benefiting both
                            users and organizations by creating a more diverse and engaged community.</p>
                        <p>As a web developer, we are required to comply with these guidelines. The effort to keep all the
                        websites under the ISI domain compliant was monumental, as we were required to review and address
                        issues whenever needed on more than <strong>900 webpages</strong>. Not only did we manage to eliminate critical
                            accessibility errors from the ISI website, but we also <strong>deployed documentation</strong> to help users
                        understand the needs and requirements for hosting accessible websites. Furthermore, this is a
                            <strong>continuously ongoing review process</strong> to ensure the quality of ISI's websites.</p>

                            Bar</strong> that sits at the very top of the website when activated. This Notification Bar is a very convenient tool
                            designed to capture visitors' attention with important messages. It can be used to communicate
                            updates, special events, or urgent announcements without disrupting the user experience.</p>
                        <p>I was in charge of developing this feature, which<strong> involves both frontend and backend
                            design</strong>. To create the Notification Bar, I had to envision a design, develop the WordPress interface settings
                        for users to configure it, convert the ideas into a functioning element, test, deploy, and add documentation.
                        Users can choose from several options, such as the background color, the expiration date, the
                        location of this banner on the website, and input a message with a custom design.</p>
                        <p>Examples of the design can be viewed on the <em>ISI Designs</em> tab.</p>

                        <p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/sharepoint/collaboration" target="_blank">SharePoint</a>
                            is a web-based collaboration platform from Microsoft that allows organizations to manage and
                            share documents, streamline workflows, and facilitate team communication. Its benefits include
                            enhanced document management, improved collaboration across teams, and customizable solutions
                            that can adapt to various business needs, ultimately increasing productivity and operational
                            efficiency.</p>
                        <p>At ISI, SharePoint is utilized for <strong>internal webpages</strong>, such as the IT Team-specific documentation,
                        photos of events, a staff portal with relevant information and announcements from the institute,
                        and other uses by different departments. With a convenient drag-and-drop building system, I have been
                        in charge of <strong>developing and maintaining</strong> many of the ISI SharePoint websites.</p>

                        <h4>Working with Action</h4>
                        <p>Action is the "Book of Books" within ISI. It is a <strong>large internal knowledge base
                            platform</strong> with over 180 informational pages and forms that explain to users the scope of all the available services, procedures,
                        equipment, and software products available or offered at ISI.</p>
                        <p>As a web developer, I was not only in charge of regularly updating existing content, but I was also
                        required to design, develop, and deploy new pages and forms from scratch. Some of the most challenging
                        and lengthy projects I worked on included WordPress documentation, with over 15 pages and forms,
                        and a resigned layout, and accessibility compliance documentation, with unique visual and functional
                        features. Overall, I have worked on mostly all the (over) 180 pages to some capacity, and in the
                        past three years the Action website has seen a significant growth thanks to the constant and consistent
                        updates.</p>

                        <p>This project is aimed at achieving Living Building Certification, and we have
                            been tasked with assessing its feasibility. We have to identify the environmental and
                            infrastructure requirements, design engineering solutions, and present a business case to
                            the client. If the Living Building Certification is not feasible, we will propose an
                            alternative. We are required to collaborate with USC’s civil-structural and architectural team to
                            integrate environmental elements such as water supply, energy, and sustainability into the
                            design while addressing project risks.</p>

                        <h4>San Diego County Water Authority Regional Conveyance System Environmental Impact Analysis</h4>
                        <p>The San Diego County Water Authority (SDCWA) supplies water to 3.3 million people and supports
                            a $245 billion economy, primarily relying on the Colorado River. To secure a long-term,
                            cost-effective water supply, the SDCWA is proposing the San Diego Regional Water Conveyance System (RCS),
                            which would directly connect water from the Colorado River to the county via canals, pipelines,
                            and tunnels. This project stems from the 2003 Colorado River Quantification Settlement
                            Agreement (QSA), which allowed San Diego to conserve and transfer water from Imperial Valley,
                            reducing reliance on imported water. With increasing costs from the current water transportation
                            system, the SDCWA is exploring two feasible routes (3A and 5A) for the RCS, which would
                            integrate with existing infrastructure and potentially lower costs through multi-use partnerships.</p>

                        <h4>A Comparative Life Cycle Assessment on Shaving Peak Electricity Demand</h4>
                        <p>This study compares two energy smoothing technologies — battery storage and energy use optimization — by
                            conducting a life cycle assessment (LCA) on the Tesla Powerwall II and the Energy Star Smart
                            Home Energy Management System. The goal was to assess their relative environmental and
                            economic impacts, as well as their ability to reduce peak energy demand. The LCA showed that
                            while the Tesla Powerwall is more effective at shaving peak energy demand, it has a higher
                            global warming impact and consumes more energy across its life cycle. The home energy
                            management system was found to be the more environmentally preferable option, though further
                            research is needed to assess its performance in renewable energy grids and its full environmental impact.</p>

                        <h4>Food Production and Climate Change</h4>
                        <p> This report addresses the environmental impacts of food production, focusing on greenhouse
                            gas (GHG) emissions and their relationship with agriculture. It provides a global perspective
                            on emissions from different food sources, highlighting that animal-based foods contribute
                            significantly more to GHG emissions than plant-based foods. The report explores the roles of
                            different agricultural practices in emissions, such as methane from livestock and nitrous
                            oxide from fertilizers, and emphasizes the importance of reducing meat consumption, improving
                            crop management, and implementing sustainable agricultural practices to mitigate climate change.
                            It concludes that significant changes in both production and consumption are needed to meet
                            future food demands and environmental goals.</p>

                        <p>The Orange County Sanitation District (OCSD) provides wastewater treatment services for approximately
                            2.6 million people in Orange County, operating two plants—Plant No. 1 in Fountain Valley and
                            Plant No. 2 in Huntington Beach. Plant No. 1 treats 120 million gallons per day (MGD) of sewage,
                            with much of the effluent reused in the Groundwater Replenishment System, while Plant No. 2
                            treats 70 MGD, discharging its effluent into the Pacific Ocean. The report explores OCSD's
                            treatment methods, including chemically enhanced primary treatment (CEPT) and conventional
                            activated sludge systems. It also evaluates the potential of Integrated Fixed-film Activated
                            Sludge (IFAS) technology, particularly for enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR),
                            which offers higher biomass concentrations and cost-effective nutrient removal, although OCSD
                            currently lacks strict phosphorus discharge requirements.</p>

                        <p>Air pollution in Los Angeles causes visibility issues, building damage, and respiratory health
                            problems. This assignment analyzes particulate pollution using data from the city, covering
                            topics such as particulate statistics, a cascade impactor for particle collection, respiratory
                            deposition, optical properties, and condensational growth under different conditions. It also
                            includes the design of an electrostatic precipitator (ESP) to reduce industrial particulate
                            emissions, which will inform policy decisions to limit air pollution. Additionally, the project
                            examines how the ESP can reduce particulate spread, including implications for the spread
