        <p>
            My name is <strong>Marco Kleimans</strong> and as of today, I am <strong class="age"></strong>. I am currently living in
            Houston, Texas, with my amazing girlfriend who is finishing her Master's degree at Rice University. I was born
            in Moscow, Russia, but spent most of my childhood in Buenos Aires, Argentina, where I grew up.
            I then moved to Los Angeles, California, where I graduated from the
            <a href="https://www.usc.edu/" target="_blank">University of Southern California</a> with a
            Bachelor's and a Master's degree in
            <a href="https://cee.usc.edu/academics/undergraduate-programs/environmental-engineering/" target="_blank">Environmental Engineering</a>.
            After graduation – and as a result of life decisions and opportunities – I decided to pivot away from Environmental
            Engineering and started working as a Web Developer at the <a href="https://www.isi.edu/" target="_blank">Information Sciences Institute</a>.
        </p>
        <p>As <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jostein_Gaarder" target="_blank">Jostein Gaarder</a> claims -
            my favorite writer and philosopher from Norway - embracing uncertainty and accepting one's shortcomings
            is a critical first step towards self-improvement and realization. His book "<em>The Solitaire Mystery</em>" has been
            a hallmark for me, as it narrates the story of a father and son who relentlessly search for their missing
            wife and mother, while strange encounters with mythical creatures along the way inspire a though-provoking
            exploration of the meaning of life. This is, without doubt, a metaphor of meaning, of reaching the unthinkable,
            and being able to enjoy the journey while welcoming the unexpected.</p>
        <p>This story is my banner: I always enthusiastic about facing new challenges that force me to step outside my
            comfort zone, but I am also pragmatic and always looking forward to learning and developing new skills.
            I consider myself methodical and organized, persevering and energetic, and both flexible and always well-disposed.
            I'm passionate about new technologies, and optimistic about the future. Having a multicultural background
            allows me to analyze complex situations from different perspectives to find the most fitting solution for each scenario.
            I enjoy learning, sharing, and helping others accomplish their goals, approaching all tasks with open-mindedness
            and excitement.</p>

                                Institute</a> is a world-class leader in cutting-edge computing technologies: AI, Quantum Computing,
                                Space Research, Microchips, Networking and Cybersecurity, Social Media and Health,
                                and many others.
                                <p>I started my job at ISI as a student worker in July 2021. As a result of my commitment, malleability, and adroitness,
                                I was later offered a full-time position as a Web Developer I. Working as a web developer
                                at ISI meant that I had to adapt to a very fast-paced, constantly evolving environment and
                                had to learn new technologies and concepts from scratch. Environmental Engineering is
                                not computer-heavy, and programming is not part of the core curriculum. However, I accepted this
                                challenge and, step-by-step, learned the tools needed to become a proficient entry level developer capable of
                                completing and excelling at my tasks in the institute.</p>
                            <p>Not only did I learn programming languages like HTML, CSS, PHP, and Javascript, but I
                                also learnt how to use tools like WordPress, BeaverBuilder, WP Engine,
                                Jira, Trello, GitHub, the terminal, SharePoint, and the
                                Affinity Suite, among others. I also had to collaborate with staff from different departments,
                                organize and share work-progress during meetings, and provide training for some of our
                                platforms. Last but not least, I was involved in promoting and catering DEI efforts, as
                                well as accessibility compliance for ISI's website.</p>
                                <p>Among the most relevant <a href="#projects">projects</a> I completed, I helped migrate more than
                                300 websites from Drupal - the old Content Management System (CMS) used at ISI - to WordPress, which involved moving
                                more than 1000 webpages from an on-premise server to the website hosting service WP Engine. This
                                included redesigning the websites and adapting the content and media to the new layout using
                                WordPress, custom-built themes, and Beaver Builder. I was also largely in charge of
                                maintaining ISI's documentation website (Action), which involved creating documentation,
                                designing the layout, and providing the most reasonable information. For more detailed

                            <p><i class="fa-solid fa-pen-to-square"></i>After my first year and a half at USC, I wanted
                            to explore practical implementations of environmental engineering. After researching available
                            possibilities, I ended up working for

                            <p>Throughout my years of experience in the lab, I was in charge of making solutions and dilutions
                            of water samples to test for the formation of byproducts using a mass spectrometer. Some of the
                            techniques used involved liquid-liquid extraction, UV radiation, and pH buffering, among others.</p>
                            <p>Self-discipline and consistency are a must. Some days, I would spend more than 5 hours at
                            once working in our projects. Being a researcher teaches one to be patient and helps one understand

                            at Parkside IRC as a sophomore - my very first job. After a year of exceptional work, I was
                            promoted to <em>Supervisor</em>.</p>
                            <p>Both as a Customer Service Representative and Supervisor I was required to be a team-player.
                            This job helped me develop my interpersonal skills and treat customers with the appropriate tone,
                            attitude, and language. Furthermore, it required exceptional time-management and organization,
                            in order to keep track of requests, packages, mail, and calls, while balancing college social life,
                            work, academics, research and physical activity. By the time I became supervisor, I was working
                            20 hours per week on top of all the aforementioned responsibilities.</p>
